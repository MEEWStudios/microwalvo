        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <img class="gamescreenshot" src="../images/emoji.png">
        <p>Brief Synopsis: Where’s Ronaldo is a competitive/cooperative two or four player game, where the players are divided into two teams. Players control a spotlight and the objective is to find Ronaldo whom can be found anywhere in a top down view of the level. Any part of the map that is not illuminated by the spotlight is darkened, and Ronaldo will not be viewable unless the spotlight is on him. Ronaldo does not move, and will explode upon being found. Ronaldo wears green stripes and a distinctive monocle, and there will be other lookalikes that will punish the player if they are mistaken for Ronaldo. Players must hover above Ronaldo for a certain amount of time to score a point. Ronaldo re-spawns again in a random location once he is found. The players with the most amount of points within the time limit wins the round and or match. In addition, players can use power-ups that will appear on the map to aid themselves or attack the opposing team. </p>
