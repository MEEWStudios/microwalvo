During today's class, we presented our game ideas to the class and gained some valuable early feedback from the ideas we had come up with thus far. Once class concluded, we met as a group to discuss the new feedback and choose how it will impact the direction and feel of our game. During this time, we discussed a new control method, the scoring system, and the issue of movement.

Until today, our game was mostly a *Where's Waldo?*/*Where's Wally?* clone, except that our character, Ronaldo, would move around occasionally, and there would be powerups that could either benefit the team who picked it up or penalize the opposite team. In order to "catch" Ronaldo, a player from any team would simply need to move the cursor and click on him. After a brief brainstorming period, we have decided to incorporate unconventional controls into the game. Each team will have a spotlight to control, and in order to catch Ronaldo, the spotlight will have to be focused on Ronaldo. Players will be able to control the spotlight with a joystick, but one player will only be able to move the spotlight along one axis at any given time. This allows two players to control both axes at the same time to move the spotlight as desired.
