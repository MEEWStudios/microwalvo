Last week we implemented our "Jailing" Mechanic. This week we've added the visual touches to top it off. We've also added sounds and custom music.

First of all we randomized the accessories that are worn by the random NPC characters, such that at the start of each round everyone has a random chance to get accessories for hats, glasses, or body accessories.

This is a closeup of the random NPC characters walking around the map, in their randomized accessories.

Accessories here include bowtie, glasses, and hats, as well as different types of clothing and different colored clothing.

With our new jail mechanic, we needed UI to communicate the mechanic effectively. Below is a grayed out version of the "Ronaldo" picture that would be seen in the UI, along with the jail cell.

We decided on these four colors red, purple, blue, and green for the different colored Ronaldos of which each will be assigned to a respective player. Each picture is displayed above the player's score at the top.

Players know what color is their own Ronaldo simply by looking at what color their own spotlight ring is. So here the red ringed spotlight captures the purple player's Ronaldo. As a result, the red player starts gaining points. To keep track of who caught what Ronaldo, a red jail cell is shown in the UI on top of the purple Ronaldo, indicating Red has captured Purple.

Our menu screen was made to match our theme with colored Ronaldos and spotlights.

And we also made a one screen tutorial to explain our jailing mechanic of the game.
