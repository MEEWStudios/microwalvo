title: Prototypes and 3d models

In the two weeks since we gained insightful feedback from our classmates, we narrowed down our game concept and started making simple prototypes in Unity and also some 3D models. Our first goal was to get the rotation of the controller stick working the way we wanted it to, and we tested this by using a wheel and calculating its angles. 


Next we worked on the behavior of Game Objects when they "hit" the spotlight. For our prototype we used a simple yellow flat cylinder as a spotlight, and wrote code to have Game Objects move to a different position when it collided with the spotlight.

When we were brainstorming ideas we decided to have Ronaldo and Fake Ronaldo teleport to another position when found, so we implemented code to do that for specifically those game objects. When the spotlight finds a good or bad item, the item will disappear. Additionally, we wrote code such that it takes 3 seconds for the spotlight to activate any of these effects.

Now we are currently working on getting the lighting to hide the game objects that are not within the spotlight.

Also below is a couple of our 3D models that we have so far.
