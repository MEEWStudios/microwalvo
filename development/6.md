Youtube video of this version running on the SAGE screen at UH Manoa: [![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/p4YyXceSEVw/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4YyXceSEVw&feature=youtu.be)

The main milestones accomplished were finishing our "jailing mechanic", randomizing shirt colors, and adding more animations such as item floating and NPC characters running away.

Here an animation was added to Ronaldo and Fake Ronaldos to show them panic and running away when a spotlight gets near.

Item bob/float animations were added to the powerups as a visual signal that they are items you can pickup.

Shirt colors were randomized.

Our jail mechanic has been implemented in full. Each player has a Ronaldo. Each player can only capture other player's Ronaldos and when they do, that Ronaldo disappears or is "jailed" and their score increases by one each second. A key will spawn on the map after a certain amount of time which the player can pickup to release their own Ronaldo from jail and stop the opposing player from gaining points.


And some concept art and Maya assets. Below is a bridge asset that will be on the map.

The two pictures below are concepts of what we will be using with our jailing mechanic to keep track of who's Ronaldo is in jail, this will be a UI element in the game. The second picture is a picture of different color hands for different colored Ronaldos.

Along with adding the UI for this jail mechanic, we will be integrating sound from our sound team.
