After considering feedback from last class about the dark/blurry aspect of our game, we decided to turn the lights back on and make our game look a little more vibrarnt. We initally wanted to darken and blur the screen in order to impose a challenge on the player and to make it harder to find Ronaldo, but then decided that the game as a whole does look a lot better with color. We also added in the walking animations so that the characters aren't just T-Posing everywhere.

This was before we decided to turn the lights back on. We first placed some free assets and also the assets that we created onto the map, making it look more like a park.

Then we added in the character animations that were created in Maya. Importing the animations took a few tries since there were specific steps needed to import them properly into unity.

These are the animations, there's animations for the Real Ronaldo, Fake Ronaldo, and just the regular characters. What you see on the second GIF is what we currently have all the normal characters doing on the map when it loads.

Using the walk animation all characters are now able to "walk" around rather than just sliding across the map. Currently there is no idle animation so characters walk in place when they stop.

We also implemented initial item behaviors, good items increase spotlight speed, bad items decrease spotlight speed. We also fixed character spawns when discovered under a spotlight to account for a bigger map, and we also made a number of items spawn randomly at the start of the game.

Looking ahead we are planning to implement our "jailing" concept that we talked about last week where a new scoring mechanic is introduced. Once a player captures Ronaldo, he disappears for a set amount of seconds and the player scores a point if held for the whole duration. Other players will be able to release Ronaldo by grabbing a "key". Also now that we have the lights turned on in our current version we might have to think about a couple things related to be able to find characters such as when characters spawn back in or with finding items.
