After considering feedback from last class about the dark/blurry aspect of our game, we decided to turn the lights back on and make our game look a little more vibrarnt. We initally wanted to darken and blur the screen in order to impose a challenge on the player and to make it harder to find Ronaldo, but then decided that the game as a whole does look a lot better with color. We also added in the walking animations so that the characters aren't just T-Posing everywhere.


This was before we decided to turn the lights back on. We first placed some free assets and also the assets that we created onto the map, making it look more like a park.

Then we added in

Another thing we worked on was the darkening and blurring of the screenview. We wanted to make it so that the screen was both darkened and blurred in order to make it challenging to find Ronaldo, rather than have him in a crowded group of people and objects, hence the spotlight. We used code that uses a shader to darken and blur the screenview of the player except for the area under the spotlights. One problem we ran into was that the code made the game run very slowly, so we fixed an optimization problem with the code where the code was doing unecessary work, making the game smoother as shown in the second GIF.

Then we implemented the basic scoring system and logic of the game where you gain a point for finding Ronaldo, and lose a point for finding fake Ronaldo, the player with the most points at the end of 2 minutes wins the game. We are also beginning to implement item effects of the spotlight as shown in this GIF. When the spotlight finds the green capusle item on the ground, the spotlight is able to move more quickly. We will be implementing more ideas for items as we continue on.

Going forward once we have our base game down, we talked about a few ideas in a meeting that we would hope to implement to add something extra to the game. The idea would be instead of having to just find Ronaldo, you would capture him for a set amount of time, and other players would be able to release him from jail. Below is some notes summarizing a meeting we had talking about some potential new ideas. The second picture is some artwork for designs of the Ronaldo characters.

In short we have implemented most of the basic game so far, going forward we will be integrating more of our custom models, and tweaking our game objective a little bit. We also will be having custom music made by a group from the adaptive music class.
