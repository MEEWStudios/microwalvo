Last week we introduced the inclusion of animations into our walkable characters. We also decided to work with a map that has the lights turned on rather than with a blurry and dark screen obstruction.

We fine tuned the navigation of the walkable characters, we initially run into an issue where characters would form weird social circles, but this issue was fixed.

We got feedback from last class to switch to an orthographic view rather than a perspective view, here is the comparison between both views. We decided to go with the orthographic view, as this will be better for controlling the location of the spotlight, and is more appropriate for this game style anyway.

Basic clothing was added to the characters as well.

Some stand-in sounds were added to the game while we wait for our sound designers to create our music and sound effects. Mii Channel music, bird sounds, water fountain sounds, and park ambience sounds were included for background noise. Sound effects pulled from youtube were also included for point sound effects, smoke explosion, and spotlight speed changes. This is what the game currently looks like as a whole.

These are the textured shirts in Maya that our designer is currently working on that we still need to add.

Still to come is our jailing mechanic that we intend to implement as well as any other feedback that will be given to us this week.
