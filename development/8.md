Last week our game was essentially finished, in our final week of the class we fixed bugs and readjusted a few things. Here is a closeup view of the state of our game as we wrap things up for the semester.

This is the start screen where you can start the game, view the tutorial, or exit. Either a controller or keyboard and mouse can control the menu.

A short tutorial screen explaining the features of Where's Ronaldo.

When the player starts the game, the timer immediately starts at 2 minutes and players and NPCs start moving.

A closeup view of what the Red Ronaldo and the Blue Ronaldos look like. These are the characters players need to look for.

When an opponent's spotlight gets close to Ronaldo, they run away.

When a player finds and captures Ronaldo, Ronaldo gets jailed as indicated by the UI element above the player name.

Capturing a fake Ronaldo just respawns that Ronaldo in a different place and decreases the player's score significantly if that player has any points. Scores don't go below 0.

A key spawns on the map when a Ronaldo is captured, this is how Ronaldo gets released.

Only players who's Ronaldo is in jail can pickup the key. This player's Ronaldo is not in jail so they cannot pickup the key, they have no Ronaldo to release from jail.

When a Ronaldo is released the jail icon is removed in the UI to indicate that Ronaldo was released and the opposing player's score also stops increasing.

Players can pickup items to help them out. This item increases the size of the spotlight.
![itembig.gif]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/unity_screenshots/itembig.gif)
This item increases the speed of the spotlight.

After 2 minutes is up, the player with the most points wins, otherwise there will be a tie.
