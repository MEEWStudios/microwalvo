Brief Synopsis
	Where’s Ronaldo is a competitive/cooperative one to four player game of Where’s Waldo. Players control a magnifying glass and the objective is to find Ronaldo whom can be found anywhere in a top down view of the level. Among many other objects found in the level, Ronaldo is free to move, hide behind objects or teleport making it harder for players to detect and find Ronaldo. Ronaldo wears green stripes and a distinctive monocle. Players must hover above Ronaldo for a certain amount of time to score a point. Ronaldo re-spawns again in a random location once he is found. The players with the most amount of points within the time limit wins the round and or match. Players can earn items that positively affect them or negatively affect other players by finding Ronaldo a certain amount of times in a row. Players cannot stay in one place, they will be punished if they “camp” a single area of the screen.
