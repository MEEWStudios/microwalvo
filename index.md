### Game Concept

Brief Synopsis: Whereâ€™s Ronaldo is a competitive/cooperative two or four player game, where the players are divided into two teams. Players control a spotlight and the objective is to find Ronaldo whom can be found anywhere in a top down view of the level. Any part of the map that is not illuminated by the spotlight is darkened, and Ronaldo will not be viewable unless the spotlight is on him. Ronaldo does not move, and will explode upon being found. Ronaldo wears green stripes and a distinctive monocle, and there will be other lookalikes that will punish the player if they are mistaken for Ronaldo. Players must hover above Ronaldo for a certain amount of time to score a point. Ronaldo re-spawns again in a random location once he is found. The players with the most amount of points within the time limit wins the round and or match. In addition, players can use power-ups that will appear on the map to aid themselves or attack the opposing team.

### Storyboard Concepts

#### Goals
- Find (and explode) Ronaldo as fast and as many times as possible
- Delay the opposing team in finding Ronaldo by using the provided power-ups on the map
- Avoid mistaking Ronaldo for one of his lookalikes

#### Rules
In order to earn points, the player must hover over Ronaldo once he is found for 3 seconds. Players cannot simply "camp" an opposing team member by following/overlapping their spotlight everywhere, or both teams will begin to lose points after a certain amount of time.

#### Obstacles

- The player can only reveal Ronaldo or other power-ups on the map by moving over them with their spotlight
- If the player mistakes and explodes a lookalike for Ronaldo, they will lose points

#### Power-ups

- Strengthening your own spotlight to earn you double points whenever you find Ronaldo
- Weakening the opposing team's guns to decrease the points they earn for finding Ronaldo
- Decreasing the opposing team's movement speed
